This is a simple program that constructs a decklist in your clipboard that jinteki.net tolerates (windows only sorry!)


Build the program.
Then call jinteki.exe IdOfNetrunnerDbDeck

You can find the id in the url of a decklist

for example http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/30658/sea-scorched-earth-advisers-inc is a valid url the numbers after decklist but before sea-scorched is a valid id so in this case its 30658
